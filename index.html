            <li><strong>1863 - </strong>He was born on 12th Jan 1863 and this day is also celebrated as National Youth's Day.His childhood name was Narendranath. </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>1884 - </strong>Swamiji had lost his father at a young age in 1884. His family was suffering from poverty as there was no earning member
  At this time, Swamiji would often lie about having lunch invitations so that his family members get to eat a larger share. In his words,"On such days, I had very little to eat, sometimes nothing at all. I was too proud to tell anyone..."
  </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>1880 - </strong>Before being initiated as a monk, Narendranath had sought divine influence from many sectors. He met Debendranath Tagore, founder of the Brahmo Samaj and father of Rabindranath Tagore, in 1880.When he asked Tagore if he had seen God, Tagore replied, "My boy, you have the Yogi's eyes".</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>1881 - </strong>No one could help Narendranath with his question about God until he met Ramakrishna Paramahansa in 1881.
  When he asked the same question to Ramakrishna, the latter replied, "Yes, I see him as I see you, only in an infinitely intenser sense." This was a far more satisfactory answer to Narendranath.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>1886 - </strong>Narendranath learned more and more about Hinduism, read Vedic literature religiously and followed every progressive idea that spread around the world.
  His knowledge of the world amplified as he could relate spirituality with humanity. He was initiated as a Hindu monk.
  After Ramakrishna's death in 1886, Narendranath sought refuge in a dilapidated house in Baranagar, Calcutta (now Kolkata). He named the house 'Ramakrishna Math'.
  This was the first memorial house to Sri Ramakrishna.
  </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>1888 - </strong>In 1888, Narendra adopted the life of a 'paribrajaka' or wandering monk and travelled across India with just a kamandalu (water pot) and two books, the Bhagavad Gita and the Imitation of Christ.
  He met many sadhus and fakirs and gathered knowledge about other religions. He also met princes and maharajas.
  Maharaja of Khetri, Ajit Singh gave him the name Vivekananda, which means the bliss of discerning wisdom.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>1893 - </strong>Swami Vivekananda started his journey to the western world in May 1893. His famous speech at the Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago took place on September 27, 1893.
  There, Swamiji promoted the ancient religion of Hinduism and called for global brotherhood beyond any discrimination</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>1902 - </strong>Swamiji passed away on 4 July 1902, somewhat mysteriously. While his disciples say he attained Mahasamadhi, medically, it was the rupture of a blood vessel that is reported to have killed him.</li>
